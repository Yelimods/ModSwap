ModSwap Testing ReadMe
======================

Testing ModSwap
---------------
Thank you very much for testing ModSwap.  Your help and input is greatly appreciated.
I don't want you to risk affecting your game folders during testing, so I have provided a testing environment, which you could unzip somewhere on your computer.  This is a mock-up of the FS2014/FS15 game folder, but it contains no real game files.  To begin testing I suggest that you install ModSwap into this.
I know that ModSwap works for me, but I need to know that it works for other people.  I need to know that it provides a useful function, and is easy to use.
It is inevitable that users will move or rename files or folders, and ModSwap has validation and error checking in place to guard against this.  As with any program, this has been the most time consuming part of developing ModSwap.  More validation and error checking is planned, and I'm sure that the need for even more will be discovered by you.  This is what I'd like you to do.  Try to break ModSwap!
During testing please contact me through PM at FS-UK, or else by email at yelimods@mail.com.  (Note: not Gmail)  Any feedback will be welcomed, and thanks again.
The following is a reduced version of the main ModSwap ReadMe file.
